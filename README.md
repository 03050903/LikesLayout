## Setup and usage

To include this library to your project add dependency in **build.gradle** file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile '$coming_soon$'
}
```

There are three implementations of LikesLayout: **LikesFrameLayout**, **LikesLinearLayout**, **LikesRelativeLayout**.

```XML
<ua.vlasov.likeslayout.LikesLinearLayout
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="250dp"
        app:likes_drawable="drawable resource id"
        app:likes_drawableWidth="custom drawable width"
        app:likes_drawableHeight="custom drawable height"
        app:likes_produceInterval="produce interval in milliseconds"
        app:likes_animationDuration="animationduration in milliseconds"
        app:likes_tintMode="off|on_successively|on_random"
        app:likes_tintColors="array resource id"
        >
        
        <ImageButton
            ...
            app:likes_drawable="drawable resource id"
            app:likes_drawableWidth="custom drawable width"
            app:likes_drawableHeight="custom drawable height"
            app:likes_mode="enabled|disabled"
            app:likes_produceInterval="produce interval in milliseconds"
            app:likes_animationDuration="animationduration in milliseconds"
            app:likes_tintMode="off|on_successively|on_random"
            app:likes_tintColors="array resource id"
            />
            
</ua.vlasov.likeslayout.LikesLinearLayout>   
```

There are the list of available attributes:

| Attribute name | Applicable to LikesLayout? | Can be overridden by child? | Description | Default value |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| likes_animationDuration | yes | yes | Animation duration in milliseconds. | 1200 |
| likes_drawable | yes | yes | Drawable that will be drawn when user presses view. | n/a |
| likes_drawableWidth | yes | yes | Custom drawable width. | 0 |
| likes_drawableHeight | yes | yes | Custom drawable height. | 0 |
| likes_mode | no | yes | Switch that allows to enable/disable drawing likes on touching child view. If `likes_drawable` is null, `likes_mode` will be considered as `disabled`. | disabled |
| likes_produceInterval | yes | yes | Rate at which new likes drawables are produced in milliseconds. | 300 |
| likes_tintMode | yes | yes | Switch that allows to enable/disable tinting drawables. | not_set |
| likes_tintColors | yes | yes | Array of colors used for tinting drawables. If array is empty, `likes_tintMode` will be considered as `off`.| n/a | 

###### Restrictions: 
* If you will not set `likes_mode` or set it to `disabled`, this view will not draw any likes on touch event.
* All attributes applicable to LikesLayout will be used as default values for child with `likes_mode` set to `enabled`.
* Custom drawable width and height will set exact size ignoring aspect ratio.
* Likes floating from bottom to top.
